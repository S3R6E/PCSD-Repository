# PCSD-Repository

This is the official repository of Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD) staff intended to be used by the Coastal-Marine Unit. All data analysis involved with Reef Cloud, Reef Scan, and Mermaid (LIT) will be here. The repository contains script codes for maps, figures and stat models.
